# Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio, where I share my experience, skills, and the most relevant projects I have worked on to date.

Original design by [Bartosz Jarocki](https://github.com/BartoszJarocki/cv).

I based my work on the project by [midudev](https://github.com/midudev/minimalist-portfolio-json/) in the following video: [How to Create a Minimalist Web Portfolio with Astro 4, HTML, CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwh92LTB-Bk), who adapted the original code to [Astro](https://astro.build/).

The content is generated from a JSON file, based on the [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/schema) schema.
